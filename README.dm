# Rock Paper Scissors – C# Console Game

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game I made to practice C# while studying *The C# Player’s Guide*. I built it myself to practice working with enums, classes, and user input.

## Features
- Two players enter their names at start
- Players select Rock, Paper, or Scissors by pressing 1, 2, or 3 keys
- Plays 10 rounds total
- Shows who won each round or if it was a tie
- Displays the full history of all rounds after the game ends

## What I learned
- Using enums to represent the hands
- Handling keyboard input with Console.ReadKey
- Working with dictionaries to store round results
- Structuring code with multiple classes and methods

## How to run
1. Run with `dotnet run`
2. Follow the prompts and press 1, 2, or 3 to select your hand
